// One entry of a CollectionSourceProviderInterface source - the "collection" block renders each as a never-persisted "collection_item" Block (see Collection.html.twig). imageUrl is an already-resolved URL: each provider is responsible for its own image storage (a real attached Media, a Vich field on its own entity, anything) and hands back a plain string, never a Media/entity reference. slug is only needed to link the item's title to its detail page: set it to whatever the source's own "detail" callable expects (see CollectionSourceProviderInterface) - left null, the title renders as plain text, same as a source with no "detail" capability at all
