// What EmailService needs to build/send a TemplatedEmail (see EmailService::send()) - from/fromName/to/toName/replyTo/replyToName left null fall back to the site-wide "email-from"/"email-to"/"email-reply-to" (+ "-name") config keys, same convention every c975L bundle already uses. copyToEmail, when set, sends a second copy of the same email there (e.g. "receive a copy" on a contact-style form), with its own Reply-To stripped. Exactly one of "template" (a Twig path, rendered with "context") or "html" (already-rendered markup, e.g. from EmailTemplateRenderer) must be given - see EmailService::buildEmails()
