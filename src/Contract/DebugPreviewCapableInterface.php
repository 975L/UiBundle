// Optional capability a FormActionInterface provider can implement when its "success" can be silent from the visitor's point of view in debug mode (e.g. SendEmailFormAction, which renders instead of actually sending when ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN + "email-debug" - see c975L\UiBundle\Service\EmailService::send()) - FormController checks for this after calling handle() and shows the preview instead of the usual flash+redirect, so debug mode still gives visible feedback
interface DebugPreviewCapableInterface
{
    // Returns and clears whatever was stashed during the last handle() call, or null if there's nothing to show
    public function consumeDebugPreview(): ?string;
}
