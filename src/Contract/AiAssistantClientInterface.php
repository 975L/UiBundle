// Asks a free-text question about the block system and returns an answer. Deliberately agnostic about what's behind it - the default implementation (AiAssistantClient) forwards to a plain HTTP endpoint read from config ("ui-ai-assistant-dashboard-endpoint"), left empty by default. This bundle ships no default endpoint and no default backend of any kind - a consuming app wanting the dashboard assistant points that config at whatever service it operates (or none, leaving the feature dark). Override this service (see Readme) to plug in something else entirely, e.g. a purely local implementation.

    // "is the dashboard assistant ready" - both AiAssistantController::index() (the question box vs
    // setup guide) and AiAlertProvider (the not-enabled nudge) call this instead of re-deriving it
