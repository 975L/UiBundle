## Features

- Dynamic block system with per-kind forms and templates
- Media uploads per block via VichUploader (auto-configured)
- Multi-file upload for kinds that opt in (`slider`, `article` out of the box) - select several files at once instead of adding them one by one
- Drag-and-drop position ordering for blocks and media
- One-click duplication of a block or a media row in EasyAdmin, including its files
- Live preview of a newly picked image in EasyAdmin, before saving
- Site-wide media roles (favicon, apple-touch-icon, og-image, logo) retrievable anywhere via `site_media()`
- Media Library in EasyAdmin: browse every `Media` regardless of how it's attached, and see where it's used
- AJAX kind-switcher in EasyAdmin
- Extensible: register your own block kinds via a service tag
- Automatic CSS injection: bundles declare their stylesheets via a service tag, rendered by `bundle_stylesheets()` in Twig
- Reusable drag-and-drop sortable script for any EasyAdmin `CollectionField`

---

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.0
- Doctrine ORM
- EasyAdmin
- VichUploader Bundle
- [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) (`gs` binary) installed on the server — required for automatic PDF thumbnail generation (see [PDF thumbnails](#pdf-thumbnails)). Optional otherwise: without it, PDF uploads still work, but no `.webp` thumbnail is generated.

---

## Installation

### Download

```bash
composer require c975l/ui-bundle
```

### Run migrations

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

### Register Stimulus controllers

**Add one entry to `importmap.php`** (one-time, at installation):

```php
'@c975l/ui-bundle/controllers.js' => [
    'path' => './vendor/c975l/ui-bundle/assets/controllers.js',
],
```

**Add two lines to `assets/bootstrap.js`** (or `assets/stimulus_bootstrap.js`):

```js
import { startStimulusApp } from '@symfony/stimulus-bundle';
import { register as registerc975lUi } from '@c975l/ui-bundle/controllers.js';

const app = startStimulusApp();
registerc975lUi(app);
```

### Making these controllers available in EasyAdmin (blocks editor, sortable, kind-switcher)

Blocks are managed through EasyAdmin at `/management`, provided by `c975l/config-bundle`. Its dashboard does **not** load your site's main `app` AssetMapper entry — that would drag your front-end stylesheet (and unused front-end controllers) into the back-office and break EasyAdmin's own Bootstrap/AdminLTE styling. Instead, it loads a dedicated entry, `@c975l/ui-bundle/admin.js`.

`block`, `eaSortable` and the Trix editor integration are back-office-only, so they live in `controllers-admin.js` (separate from `controllers.js`, which only holds front-end controllers). The bundle ships a ready-to-use entrypoint for them — no file to create in your app.

**Add one entry to `importmap.php`** (one-time, at installation), pointing directly at the bundle's file:

```php
'@c975l/ui-bundle/admin.js' => [
    'path' => './vendor/c975l/ui-bundle/assets/admin.js',
    'entrypoint' => true,
],
```

That's it — `eaSortable`, `block`, and Trix are then available on every `/management` page.

## Attaching blocks to an entity

### How block attachment works

Blocks are linked to their owner via a **ManyToMany join table**. The `Block` entity itself has no FK back to any specific owner — this keeps UiBundle fully decoupled from your domain entities. Each owner entity defines its own join table, and the `BlockOrphanListener` (auto-registered by the bundle) removes detached blocks on flush.

### 1. Implement the interface and trait

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\HasBlocksInterface;
use c975L\UiBundle\Entity\Block;
use c975L\UiBundle\Entity\Trait\HasBlocksTrait;
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection;

class Page implements HasBlocksInterface
{
    use HasBlocksTrait;

    #[ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity: Block::class, cascade: ['persist', 'remove'])]
    #[ORM\JoinTable(name: 'site_page_block')]
    #[ORM\OrderBy(['position' => 'ASC'])]
    private Collection $blocks;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->blocks = new ArrayCollection();
    }
}
```

Key points:

- Use `ManyToMany` (not `OneToMany`) — `Block` has no FK back to the owner.
- Name the join table explicitly (e.g. `site_page_block`) to avoid collisions.
- `cascade: ['persist', 'remove']` ensures blocks are saved and deleted with the owner.
- Do **not** add `orphanRemoval` — the `BlockOrphanListener` handles that automatically when you call `removeBlock()`.

### 2. Run migrations

After adding the mapping, generate and run the migration to create the join table:

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

### How block removal works

When you call `$page->removeBlock($block)`, the trait queues the block in a `pendingBlockRemovals` list instead of immediately removing it. The `BlockOrphanListener` (Doctrine `preFlush` listener) then calls `$em->remove($block)` for each queued block before the flush completes. This ensures blocks are properly deleted from the database even though the relationship is ManyToMany.

### Editable block overlay

`ROLE_EDITOR` users (and above) see a small "Edit" hover button on each rendered block, jumping straight to that block on its owning entity's EasyAdmin edit screen. Implement **`Contract\BlockEditUrlProviderInterface::getEditUrls(array $blocks): array`** (tagged automatically, picked up by `BlockEditUrlProviderPass`) and return an edit URL keyed by `Block::$id` for every block your bundle owns (e.g. SiteBundle's `Page`) - `Registry\BlockEditUrlRegistry` merges every provider's map, and edit URLs are resolved once per `Blocks.html.twig` collection (one query), not per block. Nothing to do if you don't own blocks or don't want them editable this way.

---

## EasyAdmin integration

Add a `CollectionField` using `BlockType` as entry type. The AJAX kind-switcher and drag-and-drop are handled automatically by the Stimulus controllers registered via `@c975l/ui-bundle/controllers.js` — no manual `configureAssets` call is needed:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Form\BlockType;

class PageCrudController extends AbstractCrudController
{
    public function configureFields(string $pageName): iterable
    {
        return [
            // ...
            CollectionField::new('blocks')
                ->setLabel(t('label.blocks', [], 'ui'))
                ->setEntryType(BlockType::class)
                ->allowAdd()
                ->allowDelete()
                ->setFormTypeOption('by_reference', false)
                ->hideOnIndex(),
        ];
    }
}
```

---

## Drag-and-drop sortable for other collections

Drag-and-drop reordering is handled automatically by the `eaSortable` Stimulus controller registered via `@c975l/ui-bundle/controllers.js`. No `configureAssets` call is needed.

**Requirement:** each collection item must contain a hidden `position` field whose `name` ends with `[position]`. The script detects it automatically.

Expose a hidden `position` field in your collection entry type and order the collection by position on the entity side — the grip handle and drag behaviour are added automatically.

---

## Built-in block kinds

The bundle ships the following kinds out of the box (see `config/services.yaml` for the exact service definitions):

| Kind | Category | Form type | Template |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `alert` | Elements | `AlertType` | `blocks/Alert.html.twig` |
| `article` | Elements | `ArticleType` | `blocks/Article.html.twig` |
| `audio` | Media | `AudioType` | `blocks/Audio.html.twig` |
| `banner_title` | Media | `BannerTitleType` | `blocks/BannerTitle.html.twig` |
| `button` | Elements | `ButtonType` | `blocks/Button.html.twig` |
| `card` | Elements | `CardType` | `blocks/Card.html.twig` |
| `collection` | Page sections | `CollectionType` | `blocks/Collection.html.twig` |
| `cta_band` | Page sections | `CtaBandType` | `blocks/CtaBand.html.twig` |
| `document_download` | Elements | `DocumentDownloadType` | `blocks/DocumentDownload.html.twig` |
| `expertise_banner` | Page sections | `ExpertiseBannerType` | `blocks/ExpertiseBanner.html.twig` |
| `feature_bar` | Page sections | `FeatureBarType` | `blocks/FeatureBar.html.twig` |
| `form` | Forms | `FormPickerType` | `components/Form/FormBlock.html.twig` |
| `hero` | Page sections | `HeroType` | `blocks/Hero.html.twig` |
| `image` | Media | `ImageType` | `blocks/Image.html.twig` |
| `image_compare` | Media | `ImageCompareType` | `blocks/ImageCompare.html.twig` |
| `portfolio_grid` | Page sections | `PortfolioGridType` | `blocks/PortfolioGrid.html.twig` |
| `process_steps` | Page sections | `ProcessStepsType` | `blocks/ProcessSteps.html.twig` |
| `progress_bar` | Elements | `ProgressBarType` | `blocks/ProgressBar.html.twig` |
| `rich_snippet` | SEO | `RichSnippetType` | `blocks/RichSnippet.html.twig` |
| `section_cards` | Page sections | `SectionCardsType` | `blocks/SectionCards.html.twig` |
| `slider` | Media | `SliderType` | `blocks/Slider.html.twig` |
| `text_readmore` | Text | `ReadmoreType` | `blocks/TextReadmore.html.twig` |
| `text_section` | Text | `TextSectionType` | `blocks/TextSection.html.twig` |
| `video` | Media | `VideoType` | `blocks/Video.html.twig` |
| `video_iframe` | Media | `VideoIframeType` | `blocks/VideoIframe.html.twig` |

> **Maintenance note:** update this table whenever a kind is added, renamed, or removed in `config/services.yaml`.

## Anchors (in-page navigation)

Every "Page sections" kind above (`hero`, `feature_bar`, `section_cards`, `expertise_banner`, `process_steps`, `portfolio_grid`, `cta_band`, `collection`) has an optional **Anchor** field, letting an editor build a one-page nav (a `menu_link` block - see `c975L/SiteBundle`'s README - pointing straight at a section of the same page).

- Typing an anchor (e.g. `Services`) slugifies it (`services`). Leaving it empty falls back to slugifying the block's own title.
- The final HTML `id` rendered on the section is always `{slug}-{block.id}` (e.g. `services-42`) - the trailing block id is added at render time, not stored, so two blocks of the same kind on the same page (or the same title reused elsewhere) never collide.
- In `SiteBundle`'s Menu admin, a `menu_link` block's target select lists every page's anchored sections alongside its pages/routes (`Home → Services`), decoded by `MenuExtension::getMenuLinkUrl()` into `/home#services-42`.
- Every `url`-style field on `button`, `card`, `cta_band`, `hero` and `portfolio_grid` (e.g. `primaryUrl`, `ctaUrl`, `linkUrl`) is a plain `TextType`, not Symfony's `UrlType` — so an editor can point one straight at an in-page anchor (`#services-42`) or a relative path, not just an absolute URL.

Implemented by `c975L\UiBundle\Service\BlockAnchorSlugger` (the slug logic) and `c975L\UiBundle\Form\Block\HasAnchorFieldTrait` (the reusable field + `FormEvents::SUBMIT` listener). To add the same anchor field to a new "section" kind, in any bundle (own or third-party) that requires `c975l/ui-bundle`:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Form\Block\HasAnchorFieldTrait;
use c975L\UiBundle\Service\BlockAnchorSlugger;

class MySectionType extends AbstractType
{
    use HasAnchorFieldTrait;

    public function __construct(private readonly BlockAnchorSlugger $anchorSlugger)
    {
    }

    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void
    {
        $this->addAnchorField($builder, $this->anchorSlugger); // 2nd arg: title field name, defaults to "title"
        // ...your own fields...
    }
}
```

Then, in the kind's template (`{'block' => $block} + $block->getData()` is what `render_block()` passes it - see "Registering a custom block kind" below), compose the final `id` and pass it to your section's outer tag:

```twig
<section{% if anchor %} id="{{ anchor }}-{{ block.id }}"{% endif %}>...</section>
```

No `services.yaml` entry is needed for `BlockAnchorSlugger` itself: it's autowired like any other service, from any bundle whose `services.yaml` scans its own `src/` (the convention already used by every c975L bundle) - the same way `SocialBundle`'s `SocialLinkEntryType` already reuses `UiBundle\Form\IconPickerType` across bundles.

---

## Registering a custom block kind

Run `bin/console c975l:ui:block:create` (requires `symfony/maker-bundle` in `require-dev`) to scaffold the FormType, template and test below for a new kind - it prints the `services.yaml` snippet to add once it's done. The rest of this section describes what that snippet means and the manual steps if you'd rather write them yourself.

This command runs in a **consuming app** (it needs a booted kernel with `symfony/maker-bundle` installed) and generates into that app's own `App\` namespace - it's meant for a one-off kind specific to that app, not for adding to UiBundle's own built-in catalog above. A new built-in kind (living in `c975L\UiBundle\Form\Block\`, wired into UiBundle's own `config/services.yaml`, with translations in all 3 `translations/ui.*.xlf` and a fixture entry in `BlockFixtureProvider`) is still written by hand, matching the existing kinds' conventions.

Declare a service with the `ui.block` tag in your bundle's `services.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
    ui.block.booking:
        class: stdClass
        tags:
            - name: ui.block
              kind: booking
              label: Booking
              description: A short reservation form  # optional, shown under the label in the kind picker
              category: Reservations
              form: App\Form\Block\BookingType
              template: '@App/blocks/booking.html.twig'
              pickable: true  # required - see below
              priority: 80  # optional, defaults to 0 - see below
              cacheable: true  # required - see below
              contexts: booking  # optional, comma-separated, defaults to none - see below
```

Create the form type to define the `data` sub-fields, and the Twig template to render the block on the front end. The form data is stored as JSON in the `Block::$data` column.

`pickable` and `cacheable` don't have a functional default in practice - declare both explicitly on every kind, so the behavior is readable in `services.yaml` without having to check `BlockRegistryPass`'s fallback logic.

Set `pickable: false` for a **singleton** kind: one meant to be managed through its own dedicated EasyAdmin entry (see `c975L/SocialBundle`'s `SocialLinksCrudController` for an example) and rendered wherever needed via `BlockRepository::findOneByKind()`, rather than attached per-page. This hides it from the generic per-page block picker (`BlockRegistry::groupedByCategory()`), so editors can't accidentally create independent, separately-filled copies of it on individual pages. Regular, repeatable kinds (`card`, `text_section`, `contact_form`...) should use `true`.

`priority` controls the kind's position within its category in the picker (higher shows first, same convention as the `ui.stylesheet`/`ui.script` tags); kinds sharing the same priority (default `0`) fall back to alphabetical order.

The originating bundle of a kind is derived automatically from its `template`'s `@c975LXxx/...` Twig namespace (no tag attribute to fill in) and exposed via `BlockRegistry::getBundle()`/`groupedByBundle()` - the latter mirrors `groupedByCategory()` but groups by bundle instead, for building a showcase page per bundle rather than the kind-picker's functional grouping.

`contexts` restricts a kind to one or more named contexts (e.g. `menu`) instead of it being offered everywhere `BlockType` is used — useful for a kind that only makes sense on one entity, not on every `blocks` collection in the app (e.g. SiteBundle's `menu_link`, restricted to `contexts: menu` so it doesn't show up in a `Page`'s own block picker). Leave it unset (the default) for a kind meant to be usable anywhere, like the built-in kinds above. To make a `BlockType` field filter by context, pass the `context` form option:

```php
CollectionField::new('blocks')
    ->setEntryType(BlockType::class)
    ->setFormTypeOptions(['context' => 'menu'])
    // ...
```

A `CollectionField` that doesn't set `context` (the default, `null`) sees every pickable kind regardless of its declared `contexts` — existing integrations keep working unchanged until they opt in.

`media_required: true` rejects saving a block of that kind when it has no attached media at all (enforced by `RequiredMediaValidator` on the `Block` entity itself, not by the form) — use it for a kind whose media isn't optional decoration but the whole point of the block (e.g. `banner_title`'s background image). Defaults to `false`; only meaningful alongside `media_types`.

`media_multi_upload: true` adds a "select several files at once" input next to the usual one-file-per-row media collection, for a kind where editors routinely add many files at a time (e.g. `slider`, `article`) instead of clicking "Add" repeatedly. Each selected file becomes its own media entry, appended after the existing ones. Defaults to `false`; only meaningful alongside `media_types`.

---

## Block gallery

There is no EasyAdmin block gallery anymore - it was removed entirely, not just unlinked. Its preview variants needed inline scripts for interactivity (`slider`, `image_compare`...), and a hash/nonce-based CSP (e.g. `nelmio_security`'s `csp.hash` config) can never authorize a script trapped inside an `<iframe srcdoc="...">` attribute string - that class of CSP tooling scans a response's literal `<script>`/`<style>` elements, and content inside a `srcdoc` string is invisible to that scan. Not a bug in the gallery's own templates, a structural incompatibility.

The sidebar's "Links" section (see `c975L\UiBundle\Management\MenuProvider::getLinks()`) instead links out to <https://975l.com/pages/blocks>, the c975L ecosystem's own canonical showcase of every bundle's block kinds - rendered inline in a normal page, no iframe, no CSP conflict. This is a fixed link shipped by the bundle itself, the same for every consuming app.

The fixture/showcase machinery the old gallery used (`BlockFixtureProviderInterface`, `GalleryShowcaseProviderInterface`, `BlockFixtureMediaAttacher`...) wasn't removed - it's what powers that `/blocks` page, and is available to any consuming app wanting to build its own equivalent showcase page (a plain controller/template, not an EasyAdmin/iframe one).

Kinds whose `media_types` (see above) start with `image/`, `video/` or `audio/` automatically get a placeholder attached (two images for `image_compare`, two images plus a video for `slider`, one otherwise) - no fixture provider needs to handle media itself. This is done by `c975L\UiBundle\Service\BlockFixtureMediaAttacher`, a public service that any consuming app can reuse for its own showcase page - see e.g. 975l.com's public `/blocks`, which calls `attach(Block $block, string $kind)` the same way instead of maintaining its own app-specific media mapping. Images are drawn in rotation from a small pool of 5 (`BlockFixtureMediaAttacher::PLACEHOLDER_IMAGES`) rather than a single repeated one, so consecutive kinds on the same page don't all show the same photo - call `reset()` at the start of a request/loop building several blocks so the rotation restarts at the same photo every time. These photos are Laurent Marquet's own work, used here with his permission. The placeholder video (`public/videos/gallery-video.mp4`) is AI-generated - Video generated by Leonardo.Ai <https://leonardo.ai>. The placeholder audio clip (`public/audio/gallery-audio.mp3`) is also AI-generated - Music generated by Mubert <https://mubert.com/render>. A kind with no fixture at all should show a "no example yet" placeholder instead of crashing, same as the old gallery did.

### Providing sample data for your own kinds

Implement `BlockFixtureProviderInterface` (auto-discovered the same way as `BundleWhatsNewProviderInterface` - no tag needed, just register the service). Each kind maps to one or more named **variants** - use `''` as the only key when a single example is enough, or several labelled keys to show every visual style side by side (see `alert`'s info/success/warning/danger or `button`'s primary/secondary/success/danger/link in UiBundle's own `BlockFixtureProvider`):

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\BlockFixtureProviderInterface;

class BookingBlockFixtureProvider implements BlockFixtureProviderInterface
{
    public function getFixtures(): array
    {
        return [
            'booking' => [
                '' => ['title' => 'Réserver une table'],
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

A kind with no registered fixture (empty array, or not returned at all) simply shows the "no example yet" placeholder - the gallery never breaks when a bundle hasn't caught up yet.

### Showcasing content that isn't a block kind

Some content is worth showing in the gallery but doesn't fit `BlockFixtureProviderInterface`, typically because rendering it through the real block/kind never reflects the fixture's own data anyway (e.g. SocialBundle's `social_links_display` always renders the site-wide singleton regardless of its own data, and `share_buttons()` isn't a block kind at all) or because the real template only renders something once resolved against live data this provider can't fabricate (e.g. a kind resolved against a real `Page`/route, or against an external source `CollectionSourceProviderInterface` supplies). For these, implement `GalleryShowcaseProviderInterface` instead (same auto-discovery, no tag needed) and render the underlying component/Twig function directly with made-up sample data, bypassing whatever real lookup it would otherwise do:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\GalleryShowcaseProviderInterface;
use Twig\Environment;

class BookingGalleryShowcaseProvider implements GalleryShowcaseProviderInterface
{
    public function __construct(private Environment $twig) {}

    public function getShowcases(): array
    {
        return [
            'Booking widget' => [
                'description' => 'Available layouts for the standalone booking widget.',
                // "kind" ties this to "booking"'s own category and suppresses its own regular preview
                // card (which would otherwise show up empty right next to this one) - use null if there's
                // no real block kind at all (e.g. share_buttons()). "category" overrides the category
                // directly instead (no suppression) - for a kind-less showcase that still belongs next
                // to a related one, e.g. reusing a sibling kind's own category key.
                'kind' => 'booking',
                'variants' => [
                    'Compact' => $this->twig->render('@App/booking/widget.html.twig', ['layout' => 'compact']),
                    'Full' => $this->twig->render('@App/booking/widget.html.twig', ['layout' => 'full']),
                ],
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

Each variant is already-rendered HTML (a plain string) rather than a `Block` - the gallery wraps it in the same isolated `<iframe>` a block preview gets. `'wide' => true` originally rendered a showcase's card wider, for a component whose real styles only apply above a CSS breakpoint (e.g. `share_buttons()` hides itself entirely below 768px). The gallery now renders every item full-width by default, so this flag is currently a no-op there - it's kept in the interface so an existing provider that sets it (e.g. SocialBundle's `share_buttons()`) doesn't break. See UiBundle's own `BlockFixtureProvider`'s class comment, and SocialBundle's `GalleryShowcaseProvider` for a real example.

---

## Forms

A generic, shared "form definition" system (`Entity\Form`/`Entity\FormField`, tables `site_form`/`site_form_field`) - any bundle can manage its own named row (e.g. ContactFormBundle's `"contact"`) in one place instead of keeping a private fields table, and an editor can also build a form entirely through the admin, with no bundle/code involved at all.

- **`Controller\Management\FormCrudController`** (menu entry under SiteBundle's "Forms", if installed) lists/creates/edits every `Form`. Each row's `fields` collection is a drag-and-drop `CollectionField` of `FormFieldType` entries (`text`/`textarea`/`email`/`checkbox`/`password`/`password_repeated`/`url`/`tel`/`number`/`date`), reordered the same way `slider`/`article` media already are (see `assets/js/ea-sortable.js`). A field's programmatic `name` (the HTML input name, the notification email key) is derived automatically from its `label` by `Service\FormFieldNamer` on save, scoped unique within the owning `Form` - skipped for an already-named `restricted` field, so relabelling it doesn't change the stable key other code looks it up by.
- **`FormField::$url`** (any field type, not just `url`-typed ones) attaches an optional link right after the field's label - e.g. a `checkbox` field's "I accept the [Terms of use]" - rendered by `FormSubmissionType::buildLabel()` as a real, escaped `<a target="_blank">`, the surrounding label text itself staying plain so clicking it still toggles the field.
- **`Entity\FormFieldTemplate`** (table `site_form_field_template`, managed by **`Controller\Management\FormFieldTemplateCrudController`**, linked from `FormCrudController`'s own toolbar) is a reusable catalog of ready-made fields (name, email, phone, subject, message, company, website, cgu, newsletter...) picked from a select right next to a `Form`'s `fields` collection instead of composing every field by hand - seed the defaults with `php bin/console c975l:ui:form-field-template:import-defaults`. Same `$restricted` principle as `FormField` locks a seeded template's name/deletion, every other property stays editable.
- **`FormField::$restricted`**/**`Form::$restricted`**: a field or a whole form seeded by its owning bundle (e.g. register's `email`/`plainPassword` fields, or ContactFormBundle's `"contact"` form itself) keeps its core identity locked (field type + deletion, or the form's own `name`) while staying reorderable/relabellable - enforced server-side, not just hidden by CSS.
- **`Form::$enabled`** (default `true`) lets an admin pause a form without unpublishing its page or clearing `action` - `FormController` renders `components/Form/FormDisabled.html.twig` instead of the actual form/submission handling while it's off.
- **The `form` block kind** (`Form\Block\FormPickerType`, template `components/Form/FormBlock.html.twig`) embeds any `Form` by name, anywhere a block can go. Rendering and submission handling is done by **`Controller\FormController`** (routes `ui_form_submit`/`ui_form_fragment`), not the block itself.
- **`Contract\FormActionInterface`**/**`Registry\FormActionRegistry`** let a bundle process a `Form`'s submission (tagged provider, one `getKey()` per implementation) without UiBundle knowing what that action actually does - `Form::$action` stores which key handles a given form, `Form::$actionConfig` (raw JSON, editable straight from `FormCrudController`) is free-shape config read only by that action.
- **`Service\SendEmailFormAction`** (key `send_email`) is the built-in provider: it lets a form built purely through the admin still notify someone by email, configured via `actionConfig`'s `to`/`from`/`replyTo`/`subject`/`template`/`senderEmailField`/`offerReceiveCopy` (all optional - unset ones fall back to the site-wide `email-*` config keys/a default template), or `emailTemplate` (an `EmailTemplate` name, see "Email builder" below) to send a compiled `EmailTemplate` instead of `template`. It's backed by a generic **`Service\EmailService`** (`Model\EmailSendRequest` in, bool out, `getLastError()`/`consumeDebugPreview()` for the `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` + `email-debug` preview instead of a silent real send). Implement `Contract\DebugPreviewCapableInterface` on your own action to get the same debug-preview behavior.
- **Protection**, shared with every other c975L public form (contact/register/reset): a rotating honeypot + submission-timing check (`Service\FormBotProtection`, merges what used to be separate SiteBundle/ContactFormBundle implementations), site-wide GDPR checkbox and reCAPTCHA v3 (`Service\ReCaptchaFactory`/`Form\Extension\Recaptcha3TypeExtension`, a no-op unless `karser/karser-recaptcha3-bundle` is registered), and an optional shared rate limiter (`Service\RateLimiterGuard`, configure `limiter.ui_form` in `config/packages/rate_limiter.yaml` to enable it - unconfigured, nothing is rate-limited). Every `email`-typed field also gets a live MX/A DNS check (`Validator\Constraints\DnsEmail`) on top of format/`Assert\Email` validation, and every required `checkbox`-typed field uses `IsTrue` (an unchecked box isn't `NotBlank`).
- **`Service\FormPrefillHelper`** lets app code pre-fill (and lock) a `Form`'s field(s) from session right before redirecting a visitor to it (e.g. a listing page's "Contact us about this" link setting the `subject` field) - no query string needed, cleared automatically once the submission succeeds.

## Email builder

A separate, email-safe (table layout, inline CSS, no JS) block-based system for composing email bodies (`Entity\EmailTemplate`/`EmailBlock`, tables `site_email_template`/`site_email_block`) - deliberately **not** a reuse of the page `Block` system: an email-safe vocabulary has to stay closed (no arbitrary markup can survive Outlook/Gmail), so `EmailBlock::$type` resolves through a plain `match()` in `Service\EmailTemplateRenderer` instead of a DI-tagged registry, and every kind shares one flat set of columns (same principle as `FormField`, see its own docblock) instead of a per-kind dynamic sub-form.

- **`Controller\Management\EmailTemplateCrudController`** (menu entry under SiteBundle's "Email templates", if installed) lists/creates/edits every `EmailTemplate`. Its `blocks` collection is a drag-and-drop `CollectionField` of `Form\EmailBlockType` entries, same sortable mechanism as `Form`'s own `fields`. A "Preview" action renders the compiled HTML in a new tab (admin-only, placeholder variables left untouched). Both this index and `FormCrudController`'s own show a GDPR guidance note linking straight to the `site-form-gdpr` config row, via `Twig\ConfigLinkExtension`'s **`config_edit_url(slug)`** function (falls back to the plain Config list when that slug hasn't been loaded into DB yet).
- **Block kinds** (`EmailBlock::TYPE_*`): `heading` (h1/h2), `text` (plain text, split into `<p>` paragraphs on blank lines - deliberately not rich/Trix text, keeps the email-safe HTML fully server-controlled), `button` (bulletproof table-based button), `image` (a plain URL for now, not a Media picker - see below), `divider`, `spacer`, and `fields_table` (renders a `variables['fields']` label ⇒ value array as a table, e.g. a `Form` submission's answers - see `SendEmailFormAction` below).
- **`image`'s url** can be just a path (e.g. `/medias/logo.webp`) instead of a full absolute URL - `EmailTemplateRenderer` resolves it against the single `site-url` ConfigBundle parameter (same one `fullLayout.html.twig` itself already builds the logo's `src` from), so the domain lives in one place instead of being hand-typed into every image block and going stale the day it changes. An already-absolute url (`http(s)://`, an external/CDN image) is left as-is.
- **Placeholders**: any `heading`/`content`/`label`/`url`/`alt` field may contain a `{{ variable_name }}` token, resolved by `EmailTemplateRenderer` via a literal `strtr()` against the `$variables` array passed to `render()`/`renderBody()` - **not** real Twig evaluation (an `EmailBlock`'s text is admin-authored data, not code; handing it to `Twig::createTemplate()` would open a server-side template injection hole).
- **`EmailTemplateRenderer::render()`** returns one standalone `<html>` document. When an `EmailLayoutProviderInterface` is registered (e.g. SiteBundle, bringing its own branded header/footer), the compiled body is wrapped through it - so the admin **preview** action and a real `EmailTemplate`-based send (e.g. `SendEmailFormAction`) both render the same way a recipient would actually see it. With no provider registered (e.g. an app with no SiteBundle), it falls back to its own bare, un-branded shell (`templates/emails/blocks/_wrapper.html.twig`). Implement `Contract\EmailLayoutProviderInterface::wrap(string $bodyHtml): string` (auto-discovered the same way as `BlockFixtureProviderInterface`, no tag needed - see `Registry\EmailLayoutRegistry`/`DependencyInjection\Compiler\EmailLayoutProviderPass`) to provide your own; only the first registered provider is used. **`renderBody()`** returns just the compiled `<table>` fragment, with no document/layout of its own - meant to be embedded inside a real `.html.twig` template via the **`email_template_body(name, variables)`** Twig function (`Twig\EmailTemplateExtension`, `is_safe: html`), the same way for every email that's actually sent. This is how every real send-path email shares one layout: `c975l/site-bundle`'s scaffold `registration/confirmation_email.html.twig`/`reset_password/email.html.twig` and its bundle-owned `templates/emails/contact_notification.html.twig` all plainly `{% extends "@c975LSite/emails/layout.html.twig" %}` and call `email_template_body('account_validation'|'password_reset'|'contact_notification', {...})` in their `content` block - an explicit, ordinary Twig `extends`, not a bundle-template-override. `email_template_body()` silently renders nothing if `name` isn't found, so a missing/renamed `EmailTemplate` never breaks the email it's embedded into.
- **`SendEmailFormAction`** resolves the email body from `Form::$actionConfig`'s `template` (a Twig path, e.g. one that itself calls `email_template_body()` - see above, the default `send_email` config), falling back to the legacy `@c975LUi/emails/form_submission.html.twig` when unset. An `emailTemplate` key, naming an `EmailTemplate` directly, is also available and takes over instead when set and found (rendered standalone via `render()`, no layout) - handy for a Form built purely through the admin in an app with no dedicated Twig template of its own to point `template` at.

---

## AI Assistant

Two independent, optional features sharing one display name (hardcoded `"Donovan"`, see `AiRephraseExtension::assistantName()`), both disabled by default and config-driven through ConfigBundle (`c975l:config:load-all` loads their default rows from `config/configs.json`). **This bundle makes no assumption about what's behind either feature - bring your own backend.** No default endpoint, no default API key, no bundled AI provider: every value below starts `null`/`false`, and each feature stays entirely inert until a consuming app fills the rest in.

The sidebar link reads `"Donovan (AI Agent)"` - the `"(AI Agent)"` half is translated (`label.ai_assistant_menu_suffix`), composed once in `MenuProvider::getLinks()` rather than left as a translation key, since `MenuBuilder` only ever calls `trans()` on the whole label as one string.

### Dashboard assistant ("what block should I use?")

A free-text question box (`AiAssistantController::index()`/`ask()`). **`ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` only** - stricter than the rest of the page (`"site-role-admin"`, see below): this calls a backend that's typically a shared/mutualized resource paid for by whoever operates it (e.g. Laurent's own 975l.com, across every one of his client sites), so who can spend against it is deliberately kept narrow rather than opened to every editor, even though answering "which block should I use" would otherwise suit editors best. The dashboard section of the AI Assistant page is hidden entirely for a viewer without that role, not just disabled.

| Config slug | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ui-ai-assistant-dashboard-enabled` | Master switch - while `false`, the page's dashboard section shows setup steps and a link to Config instead of the question box |
| `ui-ai-assistant-dashboard-endpoint` | Plain HTTP URL the question is POSTed to (`{"question": "..."}`) |
| `ui-ai-assistant-dashboard-token` (sensitive) | Bearer token sent with the request |

The actual call is made by `AiAssistantClient`, the default implementation of `Contract\AiAssistantClientInterface::ask(string $question): ?array{answer: string, sources: array{label: string, url: string}[]}`. It only knows how to POST to a URL and parse `{"answer": "...", "sources": [{"label": "...", "url": "..."}]}` back - it has no idea what's on the other end, what data backs the answer, or whether that endpoint mutualizes questions across several sites. `sources` is always present (defaults to `[]` if a backend omits it) - a plain `{label, url}` pair per citation, never a bare identifier a frontend would have to resolve into a URL itself, since this bundle makes no assumption about what URL scheme a backend's citations resolve to. Override the service (standard Symfony service decoration/alias) to swap in a different transport - e.g. a purely local implementation with no network call at all.

**Self-hosting your own backend instead of a shared/mutualized one.** Nothing here requires 975l.com specifically - any consuming app can point `ui-ai-assistant-dashboard-endpoint`/`-token` at a controller of its own, as long as it honors the contract above. Minimal shape:

- A route accepting `POST` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (check it yourself, no Symfony Security expected - `AiAssistantClient` sends a plain bearer header) and a `question` field (JSON or form-encoded, your choice), returning the `{answer, sources}` shape above.
- To actually answer "which block should I use", the endpoint needs context about *your* block system: build a prompt from `BlockRegistry::all()` (kind, `getLabel()`, `getDescription()`, `getCategory()` per entry) so the LLM only ever cites real kinds instead of hallucinating one - the `sources` you return should point wherever your own block gallery/showcase lives (see "Gallery Showcase Providers" below), not a fixed URL this bundle can't know.
- Same provider choice as the rephrase feature below (Anthropic native, or any OpenAI-compatible API like Euria/Infomaniak) - nothing here forces reusing `AiRephraseClient`'s config namespace, a self-hosted endpoint is free to read its own config slugs for its own key/provider/model.
- This is exactly what 975l.com's own `AiHelpController`/`AiHelpService` do (not shipped in this bundle - it's app-specific, not a bundle concern) for every one of Laurent's client sites, so they don't each need their own key: a working reference if you want to see the shape end-to-end, but self-hosting yours doesn't require reading it.

Since this is several files, not one: `php bin/console c975l:ui:donovan-qa:create` (needs `symfony/maker-bundle`, dev-only, see "Registering a custom block kind" above for the same dev-dependency note) scaffolds a working skeleton matching the shape above - a controller (`App\Controller\Api\DonovanQaController`, route `POST /api/donovan-qa/ask`), an LLM client (`App\Service\DonovanQaLlmClient`, same Anthropic/Euria dispatch as `AiRephraseClient`), a block-context builder (`App\Service\DonovanQaContextBuilder`, wraps `BlockRegistry`), a status/setup-guide Twig extension + template override for this same page (so a "Donovan (Q&A)" section appears here too, matching the two sections above), and a test skeleton. It prints the `config/configs.json` snippet for the 6 needed config slugs (`donovan-qa-llm-enabled`, `donovan-qa-llm-provider`/`-api-key`/`-model`/`-base-uri`, `donovan-qa-authorized-tokens`) to paste rather than writing it - same reasoning as `c975l:ui:block:create` not touching `services.yaml`: creating/loading app-level config entries is app-specific (`ConfigCrudController` disables manual `Config` creation on purpose, so an app needs its own `loadDefaultConfig()`-calling command if it doesn't have one yet, see 975l.com's own `AppConfigLoadCommand` for a 15-line model). `sources[].url` in the generated context builder is a placeholder (`''`) - fill in wherever your own block gallery/showcase lives, this bundle can't guess it.

### Rephrase button (content editing)

A "rephrase" action calling the editor's own AI provider directly - no intermediary, and **the rephrased content itself is never persisted or logged**, the request/response round-trip is otherwise stateless (`AiAssistantController::rephrase()` / `AiRephraseClient`). **`"site-role-admin"`** (`ROLE_ADMIN` by default) - lower than the dashboard assistant's `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` since this spends the site's own key/budget, not a shared one, but still above a plain editor. The only thing that outlives the request is an aggregate token count (see below) - a number reveals nothing about what was rephrased. The button only appears when the feature `isEnabled()` - no permanently-visible-but-disabled state, matching the dashboard assistant's own page. Works on plain text: rich formatting (bold, links, lists...) is not preserved across a rephrase, a deliberate scope limit rather than an oversight.

The result is never a straight replacement - `ai-rephrase.js` appends it after the original, separated by `\n\n---\n\n`, so both stay directly editable in the same field. An editor keeps, deletes or merges either side by hand, rather than losing the original the moment a rephrase comes back or needing a separate "apply" step.

Two independent selects are sent with the request: a style (`AiRephraseClient::getStyles()` - `neutral`/`professional`/`friendly`/`concise`/`persuasive`/`simple`/`enthusiastic`/`expanded`) and a length (`AiRephraseClient::getLengths()` - `same`/`shorter`/`longer`, defaulting to `same`). Both index a closed `const` map on the server side - an unexpected/tampered value falls back to its default rather than being forwarded to the LLM, so neither can be used to inject arbitrary prompt instructions.

Every Trix-edited field gets it automatically (`block_theme.html.twig`'s `trix_editor_widget`, no per-field wiring needed). A **plain** textarea does not, by default: the same block also renders technical/structured values dashboard-wide (e.g. ConfigBundle's Config CRUD renders its `json`-kind values through a plain textarea too), so showing the button unconditionally there would be actively wrong. A plain-text content field opts in explicitly:

```php
TextareaField::new('summary')
    ->setFormTypeOption('attr', ['data-ai-rephrase' => 'true']),
```

(see SiteBundle's `PageCrudController::configureFields()`, `summarySocialNetwork`, for a real example)

A third, field-independent spot: once enabled, the AI Assistant page itself shows a free-standing textarea wired to the same `_ai_rephrase.html.twig` partial and `ai-rephrase.js` controller - useful for rephrasing arbitrary text that isn't tied to any CMS field at all (a draft, something pasted in from elsewhere...).

| Config slug | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ui-ai-assistant-rephrase-provider` | `anthropic`, `openai` or `euria` |
| `ui-ai-assistant-rephrase-api-key` (sensitive) | The editor's own key for that provider - billed to whoever owns it |
| `ui-ai-assistant-rephrase-base-uri` | Required only for `euria` (or any other OpenAI-compatible API): its base URI, since Euria/Infomaniak AI Tools exposes an OpenAI-compatible API under a different host |
| `ui-ai-assistant-rephrase-model` | Optional for `anthropic`/`openai` (each falls back to a reasonable default), **mandatory for `euria`** - its catalog isn't static enough to hardcode a default, `isEnabled()` stays `false` without it. Recommended: `mistralai/Mistral-Small-4-119B-2603` |

`anthropic` and `openai` are called with their native APIs; any other value is treated as an OpenAI-compatible API using `ui-ai-assistant-rephrase-base-uri` as its host - this is how Euria is supported without provider-specific code.

A style selector (`neutral`/`professional`/`friendly`/`concise`) sits next to the button, backed by `AiRephraseClient::rephrase(string $text, string $style = 'neutral')` - each style maps to a fixed prompt fragment server-side (`AiRephraseClient::STYLES`), a closed list the request's raw `style` value is only ever used to *index*, never interpolated into the prompt itself, so a tampered value can't inject arbitrary instructions. `getStyles(): array` is the whole surface a custom UI needs to build its own selector.

### Rephrase spend tracking

Every provider response already includes its own token usage - `AiRephraseClient` reads it and hands it to `AiUsageTracker`, which rolls it up into one `AiUsage` row per calendar month (`inputTokens`/`outputTokens`/`requestCount`), not one row per request: a per-request log would tie a token count to a timestamp close enough to correlate with a specific edit, which the "nothing is persisted" promise above is precisely there to avoid. `AiUsageTracker::getCurrentMonth()` is the read side - shown on the AI Assistant page when the rephrase feature is enabled.

A failed call (bad/revoked key, provider outage...) is recorded on the same row instead of silently swallowed, and cleared automatically on the next successful call. While a failure is recorded, `AiAlertProvider` (implementing ConfigBundle's `AlertProviderInterface`) surfaces a dashboard-wide **warning** - so a broken key doesn't go unnoticed until an editor happens to report it. No proactive key validation on save: an invalid key is a normal runtime failure (a cheap, immediate 401 - no tokens billed, nothing resembling abuse to a provider), not something worth a dedicated "test connection" flow - the rephrase button itself just surfaces a plain error message on failure, same reasoning.

`AiAlertProvider` also surfaces two low-key **info** alerts (not warnings - being off is the normal, intended state for a site not using either feature) whenever the dashboard assistant or the rephrase feature isn't fully configured yet (missing/false `*-enabled`, endpoint, token, provider or key) - a discovery nudge on top of the Config screen's own label/description, for an app operator actively rolling either feature out across several sites.

Every one of these three alerts links to the AI Assistant page itself (`management_ui_ai_assistant_index`), not straight to the Config screen: the page is the actual "what do I do" landing spot. Each missing setup step links directly to *that* config row's edit page (`AiAssistantController::configLinks()`, one `AdminUrlGenerator` lookup per slug via `ConfigRepository`) rather than the raw config list - and for the rephrase key specifically, a short "where to get one" note per provider (Anthropic/OpenAI/Euria), same three-part structure for each (site → what to click → billing note), since the dashboard's own endpoint/token aren't self-service at all - they're whatever the backend's operator hands out, so that step just says to ask them instead.

### On cost and abuse

Both keys are the consuming app's own, entered as `sensitive` config (encrypted at rest by ConfigBundle's `VaultEncryptor`) - this bundle has no billing relationship with any provider. An app centralizing the dashboard endpoint across several of its own sites (one shared backend, one shared token) is responsible for its own rate limiting on that backend - a leaked token can otherwise be called from anywhere, same as any bearer-token API.

## Block render cache

`BlockExtension::renderBlock()` (called by the `render_block()` Twig function, itself used by the `<twig:c975LUi:Blocks:Block>` component) caches each block's rendered HTML in `cache.app` (via `TagAwareCacheInterface`), keyed by `block_render_{id}_{locale}` with an infinite TTL - no re-render, no DB round trip for the block's own data, on every subsequent hit across every visitor. `BlockCacheInvalidationListener` (`src/Listener/`) invalidates it automatically: it listens to `postUpdate`/`preRemove` on both `Block` and `Media` (an image/audio/video swap doesn't touch the parent `Block`'s own fields, so it has to be watched too) and calls `$cache->invalidateTags(['block_{id}'])`. This fires for *any* origin - EasyAdmin, an importer, another bundle - since it's a Doctrine listener on the entity class itself, not tied to a specific controller.

Locale is part of the cache key because a kind's template can render different content per `app.request.locale` even though `Block::$data` didn't change (e.g. SiteBundle's `legal_model`, which includes a different legal-text template per locale).

**Set `cacheable: false` on a kind whenever its rendered output isn't a pure function of `(Block::$id, Block::$data, locale)`** - i.e. whenever caching it under its own block id could serve stale or wrong-visitor content:

- **Embeds a per-request form** (CSRF token, session state): `ContactFormBundle`'s `contact_form` is the current example. A cached form would hand every visitor the same CSRF token.
- **Reads another Block's data**: SocialBundle's `social_links_display` is a data-less "pointer" kind that always renders the site-wide `social_links` singleton found via `BlockRepository::findOneByKind()`. Caching it under *its own* id would never see updates to the singleton it points at.
- **Queries unrelated entities live**: BookBundle's `book_series`/`book_books`/`book_to_be_published`/`book_serie_strips` list `Book`/`Serie`/`Strip` records via `BookBlockExtension`'s Twig functions - entities `BlockCacheInvalidationListener` doesn't watch, so a newly published book wouldn't ever invalidate the cache.

When in doubt, default to `cacheable: false`: the cost is one avoidable render per hit, not a correctness bug.

### Keeping a kind cacheable despite reading outside data

A kind that reads live data `BlockCacheInvalidationListener` doesn't watch would normally have to fall back to `cacheable: false` (see above) - implement `BlockCacheTagProviderInterface` instead (auto-discovered the same way as `BlockFixtureProviderInterface`, no tag needed) to keep it cacheable while adding your own extra cache tag(s) on top of the default `block_{id}`/`blocks_all` ones, then invalidate that tag yourself wherever the outside data actually changes:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\BlockCacheTagProviderInterface;
use c975L\UiBundle\Entity\Block;

class ArticlesSliderCacheTagProvider implements BlockCacheTagProviderInterface
{
    public function getCacheTagResolvers(): array
    {
        return [
            'articles_slider' => fn (Block $block): array => ['articles_slider_' . $block->getData()['pageId']],
        ];
    }
}
```

SiteBundle's own `ArticlesSliderCacheTagProvider` is a real example: `articles_slider` resolves another `Page`'s own `article` blocks live at render time, so its listener tags the render with `articles_slider_{pageId}` and invalidates that tag whenever one of that page's articles changes.

---

## Reusable Twig components

Block templates are thin adapters around a set of Symfony UX Twig components living in `templates/components/`, callable directly in your own templates as `<twig:c975LUi:Group:Name .../>`.

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Alert:Alert>` | Bootstrap-style alert box |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Article:Article>` | Single article (title/content/media) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Article:Articles>` | Loops `Article` over a collection |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Audio:Audio>` | HTML5 audio player |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Blocks:Block>` | Renders one `Block` entity via its registered kind template |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Blocks:Blocks>` | Loops `Block` over a collection, auto-wraps consecutive `card` blocks in a `.cards` flex row |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Button:Button>` | Styled button/link |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Card:Card>` | Bootstrap card |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Card:Cards>` | Loops `Card` over an externally-supplied collection (no `Block` involved) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Collection:Grid>` | Section title, followed by a grid of already-rendered items (see the `collection` block below) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Cta:Band>` | Centered call-to-action panel (title/text/button) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Expertise:Banner>` | Dark panel with text and a list of tags |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Feature:Bar>` | Row of short arguments (title + caption) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:General:RichSnippet>` | JSON-LD structured data snippet |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Hero:Hero>` | Header banner with title, subtitle, CTA buttons and image |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Image:Icon>` | Small icon image |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Image:Image>` | Responsive image |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Image:Link>` | Image wrapped in a link |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Pagination:Pagination>` | Pagination links |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Portfolio:Grid>` | Grid of project cards sourced from a block's own medias |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Process:Steps>` | Section title followed by numbered steps |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Progress:Bar>` | Progress bar |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Section:Cards>` | Section title followed by a grid of cards (icon/title/text) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Slider:Slider>` | Image/media slider |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Text:Readmore>` | Collapsible "read more" text block |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Text:Section>` | Text section with optional image |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Video:Iframe>` | Embedded video iframe (YouTube etc.) |
| `<twig:c975LUi:Video:Video>` | HTML5 video player |

Props match the Twig variables used inside each template — see `templates/components/<Group>/<Name>.html.twig` for the exact list.

> **Maintenance note:** update this table whenever a component is added, renamed, or removed in `templates/components/`.

### Cards: a grid of teaser cards

Two independent ways to get a row of image + title + description + button cards, matching two
different sources:

**1. Entered by hand in EasyAdmin — several `card` blocks.** The `card` block kind carries its own
`vich_uploader`-managed image (`media_types: 'image/*'`, same mechanism as `article` — the media
belongs to that one block, no pairing with anything else) plus optional `url`/`target`/`buttonLabel`
fields. When a media and/or a `url` is set, `blocks/Card.html.twig` renders an image + button teaser
instead of the plain content box. There is no dedicated kind for **manually entered** cards: a
"collection of cards" editors fill in by hand is just several `card` blocks placed next to each other —
`<twig:c975LUi:Blocks:Blocks>` automatically wraps consecutive `card`-kind blocks in a `.cards` flex row
(see `templates/components/Blocks/Blocks.html.twig`), the same way several `article` blocks form a list
of articles. (For a grid pulled live from another bundle's own entities instead, see the `collection`
kind below.)

**2. Any bundle calling `<twig:c975LUi:Card:Cards>` directly — no `Block` entity involved.** The
component doesn't know or care where `items` comes from; each entry must expose:

| Key | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | no | HTML `id` of the `.card` element |
| `title` | no | Card header |
| `description` | no | Plain text, shown under the image |
| `image` | no | Full URL or path resolvable by `asset()` |
| `url` | no | Link target for the image and the button |
| `target` | no | `''` (default, same window) or `_blank` |
| `buttonLabel` | no | Defaults to `url` when empty |

```twig
{# e.g. from BookBundle, mapping its own query result #}
<twig:c975LUi:Card:Cards items="{{ books|map(book => {
    id: 'book-' ~ book.slug,
    title: book.title,
    description: book.summary,
    image: book.coverUrl,
    url: path('book_show', {slug: book.slug}),
}) }}" />
```

### Collection: a live grid sourced from another bundle

The `collection` kind lets an editor drop a section on a page that always shows the latest N items
from **another bundle's own entities** (books, products, projects...) — unlike `card`, no item data is
entered on the block itself, only which source to pull from (`source`), how many to show (`limit`) and
the surrounding section heading/link. Each item is resolved live at render time and rendered through
`collection_item`, a `card`-based kind reserved for this use (never offered in the block picker - see
`pickable: false` in `config/services.yaml`), so it looks the same as a manually placed `card`.
Not cacheable (`cacheable: false` in `config/services.yaml`) — its content depends on another bundle's
own entities, which `BlockCacheInvalidationListener` has no way to invalidate on.

A bundle exposes its entities to this block by implementing `CollectionSourceProviderInterface`
(auto-discovered the same way as `BlockFixtureProviderInterface` — no tag needed):

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\CollectionSourceProviderInterface;
use c975L\UiBundle\Model\CollectionItem;

class BookCollectionSourceProvider implements CollectionSourceProviderInterface
{
    public function __construct(private BookRepository $books) {}

    public function getSources(): array
    {
        return [
            'book.collection.books' => [
                'label' => 'Books',
                'items' => function (?int $limit): iterable {
                    foreach ($this->books->findLatest($limit) as $book) {
                        yield new CollectionItem(
                            title: $book->getTitle(),
                            description: $book->getSummary(),
                            imageUrl: $book->getCoverUrl(),
                            url: $book->getUrl(),
                        );
                    }
                },
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

`imageUrl` is an already-resolved URL string, not a `Media`/entity reference — each provider is
responsible for resolving its own image storage before handing it back. A source removed since a
`collection` block was configured (e.g. its owning bundle uninstalled) doesn't break the page it's
still referenced from, it just renders an empty grid.

`CollectionItem` also takes `buttonLabel` (defaults to the raw `url` when empty) and `buttonIcon` (a
`c975L\UiBundle\Image\Icon` component `src`, e.g. an icon path from `social_link_icon()`) — both flow
straight into the transient `collection_item` Block's own teaser button, so a collection item's
call-to-action reads the same as a manually placed `card`'s.

The `collection` block's own **Presentation** field (`variant`) switches every item's markup at once,
without an app-level template override: `''` (default) renders each item as a `card`, `'portfolio'`
reuses `portfolio_grid`'s own markup/CSS instead (see `CollectionItem.html.twig`).

#### Item detail pages

A source can optionally expose a 3rd key, `detail`, alongside `label`/`items`:

```php
'items' => function (?int $limit): iterable { /* ... */ },
'detail' => fn (string $slug): ?array => $this->books->findOneBySlug($slug)?->toDetailData(),
```

`callable(string $slug): ?array` — given an item's own slug, return a plain array of template variables
(by convention always including `title`, used for that URL's `<title>`), or `null` if the slug doesn't
resolve to anything (the caller falls through to a 404). This lets every item in the source get its own
detail URL — `/pages/{page}/{slug}` for a `Page` carrying this `collection` block — with **no Page/Block
row persisted per item**: the data is rebuilt from the source on every request. Pair it with the
`collection` block's own `detailPage` field (the slug of a **real, separate `Page`** whose own blocks
render as this item's detail view, a `collectionItem` Twig global carrying the current item's data to
whichever of them needs it) — see SiteBundle's README ("Item detail pages", under "Collection entries")
for the full recipe and `PageController::resolveCollectionDetail()` for the resolution logic itself.

To also make each item's own **title** a link to its detail page, `CollectionItem` needs the same slug
the `detail` callable expects:

```php
yield new CollectionItem(
    title: $book->getTitle(),
    // ...
    slug: $book->getSlug(),
);
```

`CollectionExtension::renderItems()` builds that link itself (`/pages/{currentPage}/{item->slug}`) once
both the block's `detailPage` and the item's `slug` are set — nothing to do on the template side. Either
one missing (no `detailPage` configured, or a source whose items carry no `slug`) just renders the title
as plain text, same as today.

### Video:Iframe: consent-gated third-party embeds

`<twig:c975LUi:Video:Iframe>` (the `video_iframe` block) auto-rewrites YouTube URLs to
`youtube-nocookie.com`, and defers creating the real `<iframe>` client-side until cookie consent
is given — the block's own HTML never changes with consent state, so it stays cacheable.

It has **no composer dependency on any consent-banner bundle**. Instead it reacts to an optional,
documented contract, checked at connect time:

- a `[data-controller~="cookieConsent"]` element present somewhere on the page (if absent, it fails
  open and renders the iframe immediately — a site with no consent banner isn't blocked by this),
- a `window.CookieConsent` global exposing [`vanilla-cookieconsent`](https://cookieconsent.orestbida.com/)
  v3's API (`acceptedCategory('content')`, `acceptCategory('content')`),
- its `cc:onConsent`/`cc:onChange` DOM events, so the placeholder upgrades to the real iframe live,
  without a page reload, as soon as consent is given.

`c975l/site-bundle`'s `<twig:c975LSite:General:CookieConsent/>` is a ready-made provider of this
contract (see its own README) — but any consuming app's own banner satisfying the same contract
works just as well.

## PDF thumbnails

When a `.pdf` file is uploaded through VichUploader on **any entity** (no interface required), the bundle automatically generates a `.webp` thumbnail of the first page next to it (`document.pdf` → `document.webp` - the extension is replaced, not appended), via Ghostscript + Imagine/GD.

- **Requires Ghostscript** (`gs`) installed on the server. If missing, the thumbnail generation silently fails — the PDF upload itself is unaffected.
- **Skipped for private files** — entities implementing `VichPrivateFileInterface` (e.g. a paid download in a shop) are not thumbnailed, since there's no public preview use case for them.
- **Thumbnail width** defaults to `400px`, or reuses `getImageWidth()` if the entity also implements `VichImageResizableInterface`.

No configuration needed — handled by `VichPdfThumbnailListener`, auto-registered like the rest of the bundle's services.

## Site-wide media (favicon, logo, og-image)

A `Media` row isn't necessarily attached to a `Block` — it can instead hold one of a fixed set of site-wide graphics, identified by a `role`:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Entity\Media;

Media::ROLE_FAVICON;          // 'favicon'
Media::ROLE_APPLE_TOUCH_ICON; // 'apple-touch-icon'
Media::ROLE_OG_IMAGE;         // 'og-image'
Media::ROLE_LOGO;             // 'logo'
```

`role` is unique per value, so there is at most one `Media` for each. Create/replace one the same way as any other `Media` (e.g. from your own app's settings form or a fixture), setting `setRole(Media::ROLE_FAVICON)` — `UiMediaNamer` then stores it under a fixed, predictable filename at the root of `public/` instead of the usual per-block path.

Retrieve it anywhere in Twig with the `site_media()` function, which returns `null` if none was uploaded yet:

```twig
{% set favicon = site_media('favicon') %}
{% if favicon %}
    <link rel="icon" href="{{ vich_uploader_asset(favicon) }}">
{% endif %}
```

---

## Media Library

A `Media` row can be attached in several ways depending on the consuming bundle: to a `Block`, directly to another entity (e.g. a Page's og-image), or as a site-wide `role`. `MediaCrudController` provides a single EasyAdmin gallery browsing every `Media` regardless of how it's attached, with a click-through to edit its metadata (alt, caption, credits, CSS classes...). Site-wide role graphics stay read-only there — they keep being managed wherever the consuming bundle handles roles (e.g. `SiteGraphicCrudController` in c975L/SiteBundle). Creating a new `Media` directly from this library (with no `Block` yet) is reserved to `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` — regular admins keep adding media the normal way, through a block's own form.

UiBundle does **not** register a menu entry for it: `c975l/config-bundle` (which owns the menu registration mechanism, see below) already depends on `c975l/ui-bundle`, so the reverse would be a circular dependency. A bundle that depends on both - e.g. c975L/SiteBundle - should add an entry pointing to `MediaCrudController::class` in its own `MenuProviderInterface` implementation.

`Media::$url`/`Media::$description` back the per-project link and text of the `portfolio_grid` kind (see `MediaUploadType`'s `portfolio_grid` context) - a project card's title reuses the existing `$label` field.

Attaching more than one `Media` to a `hero` block switches it from a single static image to a pure-CSS crossfade slideshow cycling through all of them (no JS, disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`) - see `.hero__media--slideshow` in `sass/_page-sections.scss`. A single attached media keeps the plain static image.

### Declaring where a Media is used

UiBundle only knows about `Media`/`Block`; it has no visibility into which entity of a consuming bundle owns that Block, or holds a direct reference to a Media (like a Page's og-image). Each bundle that knows this can contribute that information:

1. Implement `MediaUsageProviderInterface` in your bundle - no tag needed, it's auto-discovered like `BundleWhatsNewProviderInterface`.
2. Return, for a given batch of already-loaded `Media` rows, the places they're used.

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\MediaUsageProviderInterface;
use c975L\UiBundle\Entity\Media;

class MyMediaUsageProvider implements MediaUsageProviderInterface
{
    public function getUsages(array $medias): array
    {
        // [mediaId => [['label' => string, 'url' => ?string], ...], ...]
        return [...];
    }
}
```

`url` can be `null` for a purely descriptive entry (no admin page to link to). Every registered provider's results are merged and shown in the "Used in" field of the Media Library's edit page.

## Automatic CSS injection

UiBundle provides a mechanism for bundles to declare their stylesheets automatically, without requiring manual `@import` or `<link>` additions in each application.

### How CSS injection works

1. Each bundle that provides CSS implements `BundleStylesheetProviderInterface` and registers itself with the `ui.stylesheet` service tag.
2. UiBundle collects all tagged providers at compile time (ordered by `priority`, highest first).
3. The `bundle_stylesheets()` Twig function returns the resolved list of URLs, ready for use in a layout template.

In `kernel.debug`, `bundle_stylesheets()` returns each bundle's stylesheet separately, for instant reload on every CSS edit. Outside debug (prod), it instead returns a single URL pointing to `public/bundles/build/site.css`, a concatenation of every registered local stylesheet built by `StylesheetCacheWarmer` (auto-registered, runs on `bin/console cache:warmup` / on first request after a cache clear - like any optional Symfony cache warmer). CDN stylesheets (absolute URLs) are excluded from that file and keep being linked on their own in both cases.

### Adding CSS from your bundle

**Create a provider class** in your bundle:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\BundleStylesheetProviderInterface;

class StylesheetProvider implements BundleStylesheetProviderInterface
{
    public function getStylesheets(): array
    {
        return [
            'bundles/mybundle/css/styles.min.css', // local public asset
            'https://cdn.example.com/lib/styles.min.css', // CDN URL, passed through as-is
        ];
    }
}
```

**Register it with the tag** in `config/services.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
    MyBundle\Service\StylesheetProvider:
        tags:
            - { name: 'ui.stylesheet', priority: 10 }
```

The `priority` attribute is optional (default `0`). Higher priority providers are injected first — use a high value (e.g. `100`) for reset/base styles that must load before others.

### Using it in a layout template

Call `bundle_stylesheets()` in the `stylesheets` block of your layout:

```twig
{% block stylesheets %}
    {% for stylesheet in bundle_stylesheets() %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ stylesheet }}">
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

Local paths are resolved to absolute versioned URLs via Symfony's asset package. CDN URLs (starting with `http`) are returned as-is.

## Automatic CSS injection for EasyAdmin management pages

Same idea as above, but for CSS that should only load on the EasyAdmin dashboard (e.g. `/management`), not on the public site. Keep using plain `style="..."` attributes for one-off, low-value cases (a single `margin: 0` isn't worth an extra HTTP request) — reach for this mechanism when a management template accumulates real, reusable CSS (see `templates/management/media_index.html.twig` for an example).

### How it works

1. Each bundle that provides management-only CSS implements `BundleStylesheetManagementProviderInterface` and registers itself with the `ui.management_stylesheet` service tag.
2. UiBundle collects all tagged providers at compile time (ordered by `priority`, highest first) into `StylesheetManagementRegistry`.
3. The EasyAdmin `DashboardController::configureAssets()` method (in the app or in the bundle that owns the dashboard, e.g. `c975l/config-bundle`) injects `StylesheetManagementRegistry` and calls `addCssFile()` for each entry.

### Adding management CSS from your bundle

**Create a provider class** in your bundle:

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Contract\BundleStylesheetManagementProviderInterface;

class StylesheetProvider implements BundleStylesheetManagementProviderInterface
{
    public function getManagementStylesheets(): array
    {
        return [
            'bundles/mybundle/css/management.min.css',
        ];
    }
}
```

**Register it with the tag** in `config/services.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
    MyBundle\Service\StylesheetProvider:
        tags:
            - { name: 'ui.management_stylesheet', priority: 10 }
```

The `priority` attribute is optional (default `0`). Higher priority providers are injected first — use a high value (e.g. `100`) for reset/base styles that must load before others.

### Consuming it in the dashboard controller

```php
use c975L\UiBundle\Registry\StylesheetManagementRegistry;

public function __construct(
    private readonly StylesheetManagementRegistry $stylesheetManagementRegistry,
) {}

public function configureAssets(): Assets
{
    $assets = Assets::new();

    foreach ($this->stylesheetManagementRegistry->all() as $stylesheet) {
        $assets->addCssFile($stylesheet);
    }

    return $assets;
}
```

Unlike the JS admin mechanism (`BundleScriptAdminProviderInterface`), no AssetMapper/importmap entry is needed — `addCssFile()` resolves plain public paths via Symfony's asset package, same as `getStylesheets()` above.
